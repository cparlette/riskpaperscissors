# riskpaperscissors
Combination of Risk and Rock Paper Scissors for #GitHubGameOff for November 2018.  The theme of [GameOff2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018) is "hybrid".

## Prerequisites
RiskPaperScissors requires Python3 and Pygame to operate.

See https://www.python.org/downloads/ to install Python3 for your OS.

See https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted to install Pygame.

## Running the game
Clone this repo, then run `python3 main.py` to start.

## Controls
Press "R" during either of the first 2 setup phases ("Pick Starting Countries" or "Allocate All Armies") to randomize that phase.  This helps for testing later phases.

During RockPaperScissors battles, player 1 uses A=rock, S=paper, D=scissors, while player 2 uses J=rock, K=paper, and L=scissors.
